# DMP Tool Documenation
This is the primary repository for documentation and tickets relating to the DMP Tool application, rebuilt for release in 2026.  User-facing help and general documentation will all live in this repository, while technical documentation related to specific code repositories will remain in those repositories.

This repository is a work in progress!

## Issue Creation
This repository is the primary location for all GitHub Issues (also called "tickets") for work to be done on the DMP Tool application related to the 2026 rebuild.  Bug reports, feature requests, and new development work should all be created and tracked in this repository, using the provided Issue Templates. At initial triage, tickets will be labeled with relevant work areas and priority.  When work is being done, code will commited to the relevant repository, and linked back to the Issue in this repo.

**Bug Reports**: Any unexpected or unintended behavior related to work that has been merged in already. These can come from internal or external users.

**Feature Requests**: A suggestion or idea for the app that would need to have design or other decision work done to become a task. These can come from internal or external users.

**Task Tickets**: Work that has defined outcomes ready to be implemented (or will be the time it is assigned) at an appropriate time.  These should only be created by internal CDL members.
